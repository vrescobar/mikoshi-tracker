# @mikoshi-tracker/mcp

`@mikoshi-tracker/mcp` is a generic `stdio` MCP server for MikoshiTracker. It exposes the full personal-token-compatible `habits`, `today`, and `stats` API surface to MCP clients without adding a second auth flow.

This package is usable today with generic MCP clients and operators. It stays thin on purpose: it connects to an existing MikoshiTracker API, reuses the shipped REST contracts, and expects the same personal API token you already use elsewhere.

## What You Need

- A running MikoshiTracker API base URL, for example `https://your-mikoshi-tracker.example.com/api`
- A personal API token created from the MikoshiTracker web UI
- Node.js 20+

Runtime configuration:

- `MIKOSHI_TRACKER_API_URL` - required
- `MIKOSHI_TRACKER_API_TOKEN` - required
- `--api-url` - optional CLI override for `MIKOSHI_TRACKER_API_URL`
- `--timeout` - optional request timeout in milliseconds

## Generic MCP Client Setup

Use this shape first in any MCP client that supports `command` / `args` / `env` server configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mikoshi-tracker": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@mikoshi-tracker/mcp"],
      "env": {
        "MIKOSHI_TRACKER_API_URL": "https://your-mikoshi-tracker.example.com/api",
        "MIKOSHI_TRACKER_API_TOKEN": "your-personal-api-token"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Optional timeout override:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mikoshi-tracker": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@mikoshi-tracker/mcp", "--timeout", "15000"],
      "env": {
        "MIKOSHI_TRACKER_API_URL": "https://your-mikoshi-tracker.example.com/api",
        "MIKOSHI_TRACKER_API_TOKEN": "your-personal-api-token"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

If your client can inject environment variables but prefers flags for URLs, `--api-url` is also supported.

## Claude Code Example

For Claude Code, use the same `stdio` server shape in your MCP configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mikoshi-tracker": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@mikoshi-tracker/mcp", "--timeout", "15000"],
      "env": {
        "MIKOSHI_TRACKER_API_URL": "https://your-mikoshi-tracker.example.com/api",
        "MIKOSHI_TRACKER_API_TOKEN": "your-personal-api-token"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## MCP Inspector Example

For manual probing and debugging, launch the server through MCP Inspector:

```bash
MIKOSHI_TRACKER_API_URL="https://your-mikoshi-tracker.example.com/api" \
MIKOSHI_TRACKER_API_TOKEN="your-personal-api-token" \
npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/inspector npx -y @mikoshi-tracker/mcp
```

## OpenClaw Setup

OpenClaw should now prefer the native plugin path:

- Native package: [`../openclaw-plugin/README.md`](../openclaw-plugin/README.md)
- Canonical native asset: [`../openclaw-plugin/examples/openclaw-plugin.jsonc`](../openclaw-plugin/examples/openclaw-plugin.jsonc)
- Generic MCP OpenClaw example: [`examples/openclaw.jsonc`](examples/openclaw.jsonc)

Keep `@mikoshi-tracker/mcp` for these cases:

- generic MCP hosts
- `bootstrap-token`
- hosts that still require MCP transport and cannot load the native OpenClaw plugin

### Connection order

1. Decide whether you already have a personal API token.
2. If not, run the one-shot `bootstrap-token` helper first so runtime still uses `MIKOSHI_TRACKER_API_TOKEN` instead of an account password.
3. Store the returned token in the secret slot that your host will later expose as `MIKOSHI_TRACKER_API_TOKEN`.
4. For OpenClaw, switch to the native plugin asset instead of the older MCP example.
5. Use this MCP package only when the host still needs MCP transport.

The steady-state runtime never accepts account passwords in place of `MIKOSHI_TRACKER_API_TOKEN`. `bootstrap-token` is a one-shot setup helper for turning account credentials into the personal token that a native plugin or MCP host should inject afterward.

Example bootstrap flow:

```bash
npx -y @mikoshi-tracker/mcp bootstrap-token \
  --api-url https://your-mikoshi-tracker.example.com/api \
  --email you@example.com
```

If the account already has a personal API token, the helper may require `--force` before rotating it. Keep the returned token in your host secret store and continue using the normal runtime env names only.

## Tool Surface

All tools use the authenticated MikoshiTracker API behind the scenes and return structured data that matches the existing contracts.

| Tool | Route | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `habits_list` | `GET /habits` | List the user's habits so you can identify a target before editing, archiving, or summarizing by name, category, kind, or status. |
| `habits_add` | `POST /habits` | Create a new habit definition when the user explicitly wants to add a habit, recurrence rule, target, or category. |
| `habits_get_detail` | `GET /habits/:habitId` | Read one habit's full configuration, stats, and history before non-trivial edits or when the user asks for deep detail about that habit. |
| `habits_edit` | `PATCH /habits/:habitId` | Change an existing habit's settings after you have identified the correct habit and confirmed the user wants to modify it. |
| `habits_archive` | `POST /habits/:habitId/archive` | Archive a habit only when the user explicitly wants to shelve it without losing history. |
| `habits_restore` | `POST /habits/:habitId/restore` | Restore an archived habit only when the user explicitly wants it active again. |
| `today_get_summary` | `GET /today` | Read today's canonical checklist first when the user asks what is due, what remains, or whether today is already complete. |
| `today_complete` | `POST /today/complete` | Mark a boolean habit complete for today only when the user clearly asks to check off a specific today item. |
| `today_set_total` | `POST /today/set-total` | Set today's numeric progress for a quantified habit when the user gives a concrete amount, total, or measurement for today. |
| `today_undo` | `POST /today/undo` | Undo today's latest mutation only when the user explicitly asks to revert or correct the most recent today action. |
| `stats_get_overview` | `GET /stats/overview` | Read high-level analytics when the user wants a progress review, trend summary, or overall habit health snapshot. |
| `attachment_upload` | `POST /attachments/base64` | Attach an image to a check-in entry when the user shares a photo for a habit (a meal photo, proof a chore is done, etc.). Pass the mutationId returned by a today_* action and the image as base64. |
| `attachment_list` | `GET /attachments` | List the image attachments of a check-in entry (mutationId) or of an entire habit (habitId), returning each attachment id and its metadata. |
| `attachment_get` | `GET /attachments/:id/file` | Fetch a stored attachment image by id and return it as an image so you can see and reason about the photo (e.g. estimate calories from a meal photo). |
| `entry_types_list` | `GET /entry-types` | List all active entry types (habit_boolean, habit_quantity, food_meal, and any custom types) with their schemas and cadence. |
| `entry_types_get` | `GET /entry-types/:slug` | Read one entry type's full schema, configuration descriptor, and aggregation spec by its slug. |
| `entries_list` | `GET /entries` | List the user's entries filtered by entry type, active status, or name query. |
| `entries_create` | `POST /entries` | Create a new entry for a given entry type, with config validated against the type's configSchema. |
| `entries_get` | `GET /entries/:id` | Read one entry's full configuration and metadata by its id. |
| `entries_update` | `PATCH /entries/:id` | Update an entry's name, description, category, or config. |
| `entries_archive` | `POST /entries/:id/archive` | Archive an entry, making it read-only and hiding it from active lists. |
| `entries_restore` | `POST /entries/:id/restore` | Restore an archived entry, making it active again. |
| `entries_add_event` | `POST /entries/:id/events` | Record a new event for an entry, with payload validated against the entry type's payloadSchema. |
| `events_list` | `GET /events` | List events for a user's entries, with optional filters for entry, type, date range, and pagination. |
| `events_get` | `GET /events/:eventId` | Read one event's full payload, mutations, and attachments by its id. |
| `events_update` | `PATCH /events/:eventId` | Partially update an event's payload or note, creating an UPDATE mutation in the audit trail. |
| `events_delete` | `DELETE /events/:eventId` | Soft-delete an event by recording a DELETE mutation; the event remains in the audit trail. |
| `events_undo` | `POST /events/:eventId/undo` | Revert the last non-UNDO mutation on an event by replaying the audit trail. |
| `aggregations_query` | `GET /aggregations` | Run a declarative aggregation over entry events, supporting sum, count, completion-rate, streak, and missing-days broken down by day, week, month, or total. |

## AI Guidance

Besides the tool catalog, the MCP server exposes a small workflow layer for hosts that support MCP prompts and resources:

- Prompt: `mikoshi_tracker_assistant_workflow`
- Resource: `mikoshi-tracker://guides/workflow`
- Purpose: teach a today-first, read-before-write tool sequence so hosts do not have to infer safe mutation behavior from route names alone

Recommended usage:

1. Start with `today_get_summary` for anything about today's checklist or next actions.
2. Use `habits_list` / `habits_get_detail` to identify the correct habit before editing or archiving.
3. Mutate only on explicit user intent; if multiple habits could match, clarify before calling a write tool.
4. Use `stats_get_overview` for review and trend questions, optionally pairing it with `today_get_summary` for concrete next steps.

If your agent platform supports repo-local Skills, MikoshiTracker also ships both [`.agents/skills/mikoshi-tracker-mcp`](../../.agents/skills/mikoshi-tracker-mcp/SKILL.md) for Codex/Claude-style agents and [`../../skills/mikoshi-tracker-mcp/SKILL.md`](../../skills/mikoshi-tracker-mcp/SKILL.md) for OpenClaw-style workspace skill discovery.

For a broader explanation of when to connect MCP only, how to pair OpenClaw workspace skills with a real MCP runner, and how to explain this to robot operators, see [AI Agent Integration / AI 机器人接入](../../docs/ai-agent-integration.md).

The `mikoshi-tracker-mcp` Skill is documented as a bilingual trigger layer for Skill-aware agents. Typical requests include:

- `What should I do today?` / `今天该做什么？`
- `What habits are still left today?` / `今天还剩哪些习惯没做？`
- `Mark reading as done.` / `帮我把阅读打卡。`
- `Undo the last check-in.` / `撤销刚才的打卡。`
- `How am I doing this week?` / `我这周做得怎么样？`

## Notes

- This package does not support browser-session or admin-only routes.
- This package currently targets local `stdio` MCP usage, not remote Streamable HTTP transport.
- OpenClaw compatibility in this repository is a host-contract layer on top of the same package/runtime surface; it does not introduce a second server mode.
- The package version is still `0.x`, but the generic-client flow above is intended for real use now.
