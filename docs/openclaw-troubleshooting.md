# OpenClaw Troubleshooting

Use this guide when the documented native OpenClaw setup still does not work after you copied [`../packages/openclaw-plugin/examples/openclaw-plugin.jsonc`](../packages/openclaw-plugin/examples/openclaw-plugin.jsonc).

This is a troubleshooting guide, not a second setup path.

Supported native runtime contract:

- `HAAABIT_API_URL`
- `HAAABIT_API_TOKEN`
- optional Skill layer via [`../skills/haaabit-mcp/SKILL.md`](../skills/haaabit-mcp/SKILL.md)

## Decision Points

## 1. The plugin does not load

Checklist:

1. Confirm OpenClaw is using [`../packages/openclaw-plugin/examples/openclaw-plugin.jsonc`](../packages/openclaw-plugin/examples/openclaw-plugin.jsonc).
2. Confirm the host can resolve `@haaabit/openclaw-plugin`.
3. Confirm `HAAABIT_API_URL` and `HAAABIT_API_TOKEN` are injected into the plugin runtime.

## 2. The runtime rejects the token value

The plugin is intentionally strict here.

- `HAAABIT_API_URL` should be your API base URL such as `https://your-haaabit.example.com/api`.
- `HAAABIT_API_TOKEN` should be a personal API token.
- If startup says the value looks like an email or URL, fix secret mapping instead of trying alternate env names.

## 3. A tool returns a structured error

Do not branch on the prose first. Branch on machine-readable fields:

- `error.category`
- `error.retryable`
- `error.resolution`
- `error.suggestedTool`

Typical cases:

- `wrong_kind` -> switch to the tool named by `suggestedTool`
- `not_found` -> re-read and get a valid `habitId`
- `auth` -> replace token and retry
- `timeout` / `network` -> safe retry path

## 4. You only have account credentials and no token yet

Use the one-shot helper:

```bash
npx -y @haaabit/mcp bootstrap-token \
  --api-url https://your-haaabit.example.com/api \
  --email you@example.com
```

After success:

1. Save the returned personal API token in the secret store used by OpenClaw.
2. Put that token into `HAAABIT_API_TOKEN`.
3. Go back to the native plugin setup from [`../packages/openclaw-plugin/examples/openclaw-plugin.jsonc`](../packages/openclaw-plugin/examples/openclaw-plugin.jsonc).
