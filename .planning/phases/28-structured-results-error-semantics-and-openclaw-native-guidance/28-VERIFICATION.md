# Phase 28: Structured Results, Error Semantics, and OpenClaw-native Guidance Verification Report

**Phase Goal:** Make the native plugin agent-friendly by locking structured JSON success/error contracts and routing OpenClaw docs to the native plugin path first.
**Verified:** 2026-03-11T21:23:00+08:00
**Status:** passed

## Goal Achievement

### Observable Truths

| # | Truth | Status | Evidence |
|---|-------|--------|----------|
| 1 | Every native plugin tool now returns one stable machine-readable success envelope. | ✓ VERIFIED | `packages/openclaw-plugin/test/result-envelope.test.ts`, `test/read-tools.test.ts`, and `test/mutation-tools.test.ts` passed against `{ ok, toolName, summary, data }`. |
| 2 | Native and shared runtime failures now distinguish timeout/network/auth/not_found/wrong_kind with actionable structured fields. | ✓ VERIFIED | `packages/openclaw-plugin/test/error-semantics.test.ts`, `packages/mcp/test/client/errors.test.ts`, and `packages/mcp/test/tools/mutation-errors.test.ts` passed with category/resolution/retryable/suggestedTool expectations. |
| 3 | Repo docs now route OpenClaw to the native plugin first while keeping MCP guidance for other hosts. | ✓ VERIFIED | `packages/openclaw-plugin/test/docs-native-openclaw.test.ts` passed after updates to `README.md`, `docs/ai-agent-integration.md`, `docs/openclaw-validation-checklist.md`, and `docs/openclaw-troubleshooting.md`. |

**Score:** 3/3 truths verified

### Required Artifacts

| Artifact | Expected | Status | Details |
|----------|----------|--------|---------|
| `packages/openclaw-plugin/test/result-envelope.test.ts` | Native success envelope coverage | ✓ EXISTS + PASSED | Pins the native success contract. |
| `packages/openclaw-plugin/test/error-semantics.test.ts` | Native error taxonomy coverage | ✓ EXISTS + PASSED | Covers timeout/network/auth/not_found/wrong_kind. |
| `packages/openclaw-plugin/test/docs-native-openclaw.test.ts` | Native-first doc smoke coverage | ✓ EXISTS + PASSED | Guards against MCP-first OpenClaw drift. |
| `packages/openclaw-plugin/README.md` | Package-local native plugin guide | ✓ EXISTS + PASSED | Documents env and result/error contract. |
| `packages/openclaw-plugin/examples/openclaw-plugin.jsonc` | Canonical native setup asset | ✓ EXISTS + PASSED | Removes the OpenClaw default dependency on the MCP example. |

**Artifacts:** 5/5 verified

### Requirements Coverage

| Requirement | Status | Blocking Issue |
|-------------|--------|----------------|
| RESP-01: Every native plugin tool returns structured JSON intended for agent consumption. | ✓ SATISFIED | - |
| RESP-02: Network and upstream API failures clearly distinguish connectivity/timeouts from auth failures. | ✓ SATISFIED | - |
| RESP-03: Missing habit targets and wrong-kind mutations tell the agent whether it needs a different `habitId` or tool. | ✓ SATISFIED | - |
| VER-02: MikoshiTracker ships one canonical OpenClaw-native setup path and updates docs/examples accordingly. | ✓ SATISFIED | - |

**Coverage:** 4/4 requirements satisfied

## Anti-Patterns Found

None blocking after verification.

One intentional scope boundary remains:
- Real OpenClaw host loading and end-to-end native plugin execution still require the external-host verification planned in Phase 29.

## Human Verification Required

One external-host check remains non-blocking:
- Load the native plugin in a real OpenClaw workspace, execute one read and one safe mutation, and confirm the actual host surfaces the structured result/error contract as documented.

## Commands Run

- `pnpm typecheck`
- `pnpm --filter @mikoshi-tracker/openclaw-plugin build`
- `pnpm --filter @mikoshi-tracker/openclaw-plugin exec vitest run test/docs-native-openclaw.test.ts test/result-envelope.test.ts test/error-semantics.test.ts test/read-tools.test.ts test/mutation-tools.test.ts`
- `pnpm --filter @mikoshi-tracker/mcp exec vitest run test/client/api-client.test.ts test/client/errors.test.ts test/tools/habits-read.test.ts test/tools/habits-write.test.ts test/tools/today-stats-read.test.ts test/tools/today-write.test.ts test/tools/mutation-errors.test.ts`
