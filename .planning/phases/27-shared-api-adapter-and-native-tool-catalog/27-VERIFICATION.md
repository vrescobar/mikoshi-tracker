# Phase 27: Shared API Adapter and Native Tool Catalog Verification Report

**Phase Goal:** Reuse the shipped MikoshiTracker API/client/contracts stack to expose the full habits/today/stats tool catalog as native OpenClaw tools.
**Verified:** 2026-03-11T20:55:30+08:00
**Status:** passed

## Goal Achievement

### Observable Truths

| # | Truth | Status | Evidence |
|---|-------|--------|----------|
| 1 | The native plugin now uses a host-neutral shared runtime seam instead of placeholder-only registration. | ✓ VERIFIED | `packages/mcp/src/client/error-payload.ts`, `packages/mcp/src/tools/catalog.ts`, `packages/mcp/src/tools/runtime.ts`, and `packages/openclaw-plugin/src/native-handlers.ts` now exist; `test/shared-runtime.test.ts` passed. |
| 2 | The native plugin now exposes real read tools for habits, today summary, and stats overview on top of the shared runtime seam. | ✓ VERIFIED | `packages/openclaw-plugin/test/read-tools.test.ts` passed and asserted `habits_list`, `habits_get_detail`, `today_get_summary`, and `stats_get_overview` hit the direct API-backed path. |
| 3 | The native plugin now exposes the shipped mutation surface for habit management and today actions while preserving shared auth/runtime semantics. | ✓ VERIFIED | `packages/openclaw-plugin/test/mutation-tools.test.ts` passed for habits and today mutations, while targeted MCP mutation/error regressions also remained green. |

**Score:** 3/3 truths verified

### Required Artifacts

| Artifact | Expected | Status | Details |
|----------|----------|--------|---------|
| `packages/mcp/src/client/error-payload.ts` | Host-neutral error payload mapping | ✓ EXISTS + PASSED | Shared by both MCP and native plugin paths. |
| `packages/mcp/src/tools/catalog.ts` | Shared MikoshiTracker tool metadata | ✓ EXISTS + PASSED | Keeps tool vocabulary and schema metadata single-sourced. |
| `packages/mcp/src/tools/runtime.ts` | Shared tool-operation aggregation | ✓ EXISTS + PASSED | Aggregates reusable read/write operations for both hosts. |
| `packages/openclaw-plugin/src/native-handlers.ts` | Real native handlers | ✓ EXISTS + PASSED | Wraps shared operations into native success/error payloads. |
| `packages/openclaw-plugin/test/shared-runtime.test.ts` | Shared-seam coverage | ✓ EXISTS + PASSED | Proves runtime imports are host-neutral and error payload mapping is shared. |
| `packages/openclaw-plugin/test/read-tools.test.ts` | Native read coverage | ✓ EXISTS + PASSED | Covers habits, today, and stats reads. |
| `packages/openclaw-plugin/test/mutation-tools.test.ts` | Native mutation coverage | ✓ EXISTS + PASSED | Covers habits/today writes plus structured error behavior. |

**Artifacts:** 7/7 verified

### Requirements Coverage

| Requirement | Status | Blocking Issue |
|-------------|--------|----------------|
| OCP-02: The native OpenClaw plugin exposes the same intent coverage as the shipped MikoshiTracker tool surface. | ✓ SATISFIED | - |
| SHRD-01: The plugin reuses the existing MikoshiTracker API client, shared contracts/types, and bearer-token auth semantics. | ✓ SATISFIED | - |
| SHRD-03: The OpenClaw-native transport layer stays thin, with domain behavior still enforced by the shipped MikoshiTracker API. | ✓ SATISFIED | - |

**Coverage:** 3/3 requirements satisfied

## Anti-Patterns Found

None blocking after verification.

One intentional scope boundary remains:
- Native success/error envelope hardening and operator-facing guidance are still deferred to Phase 28 by design.

## Human Verification Required

One external-host check remains non-blocking:
- Load the plugin in a real OpenClaw workspace and verify one read tool plus one safe mutation from the actual host UI/session.
