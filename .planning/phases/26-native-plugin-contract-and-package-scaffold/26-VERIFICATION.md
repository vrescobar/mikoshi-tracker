# Phase 26: Native Plugin Contract and Package Scaffold Verification Report

**Phase Goal:** Define the OpenClaw-native plugin contract, add the new package/runtime scaffold, register the shipped MikoshiTracker tool surface natively, and fail fast on bad runtime config without reintroducing MCP as an internal dependency.
**Verified:** 2026-03-11T20:09:20+08:00
**Status:** passed

## Goal Achievement

### Observable Truths

| # | Truth | Status | Evidence |
|---|-------|--------|----------|
| 1 | The repo now contains a real `packages/openclaw-plugin` workspace package with an OpenClaw-native manifest and activation entrypoint. | ✓ VERIFIED | `packages/openclaw-plugin/package.json`, `packages/openclaw-plugin/openclaw.plugin.json`, and `packages/openclaw-plugin/src/index.ts` now exist; `test/plugin-manifest.test.ts` and `test/plugin-bootstrap.test.ts` passed. |
| 2 | The native plugin exposes the shipped MikoshiTracker habits/today/stats vocabulary through native registration instead of an MCP wrapper. | ✓ VERIFIED | `packages/openclaw-plugin/src/tool-catalog.ts` and `src/register-tools.ts` register the expected tool names, and `test/tool-catalog.test.ts` plus `test/tool-registration.test.ts` passed. |
| 3 | Plugin startup fails fast and clearly when `MIKOSHI_TRACKER_API_URL` or `MIKOSHI_TRACKER_API_TOKEN` is missing or malformed, while redacting token material. | ✓ VERIFIED | `packages/openclaw-plugin/src/config/env.ts` and `src/errors.ts` now implement strict validation and redaction, and `test/config/env.test.ts` plus `test/plugin-startup-errors.test.ts` passed. |

**Score:** 3/3 truths verified

### Required Artifacts

| Artifact | Expected | Status | Details |
|----------|----------|--------|---------|
| `packages/openclaw-plugin/package.json` | First-class workspace package metadata and scripts | ✓ EXISTS + SUBSTANTIVE | Includes package name, build/test scripts, exports, and engine target. |
| `packages/openclaw-plugin/openclaw.plugin.json` | Native plugin manifest | ✓ EXISTS + SUBSTANTIVE | Declares the native plugin id, runtime, and entry. |
| `packages/openclaw-plugin/src/index.ts` | Bootstrap activation entrypoint | ✓ EXISTS + PASSED | Activation validates env, builds the catalog, and registers native tools. |
| `packages/openclaw-plugin/src/tool-catalog.ts` | Shared MikoshiTracker tool surface mapping | ✓ EXISTS + PASSED | Keeps names, descriptions, and schemas aligned with the shipped MikoshiTracker vocabulary. |
| `packages/openclaw-plugin/src/register-tools.ts` | Native tool registration layer | ✓ EXISTS + PASSED | Uses `api.registerTool(...)` and returns explicit deferred placeholders instead of MCP routing. |
| `packages/openclaw-plugin/src/config/env.ts` | Exact runtime env parser | ✓ EXISTS + PASSED | Locks `MIKOSHI_TRACKER_API_URL` and `MIKOSHI_TRACKER_API_TOKEN` as the only runtime contract. |
| `packages/openclaw-plugin/test/*.test.ts` | Contract/config smoke coverage | ✓ EXISTS + PASSED | All six package-local tests passed. |

**Artifacts:** 7/7 verified

### Requirements Coverage

| Requirement | Status | Blocking Issue |
|-------------|--------|----------------|
| OCP-01: OpenClaw should gain a native plugin package/tool surface rather than only a skill-plus-MCP path. | ✓ SATISFIED | - |
| OCP-03: The native OpenClaw path must not hide an MCP bootstrap/fallback behind the plugin layer. | ✓ SATISFIED | - |
| SHRD-02: Runtime config must stay exact, fail fast, and produce clear secret-safe diagnostics. | ✓ SATISFIED | - |

**Coverage:** 3/3 requirements satisfied

## Anti-Patterns Found

None blocking after verification.

One deliberate scope boundary remains:
- Tool handlers still return explicit `PHASE_27_PENDING` placeholders; real API-backed read/write behavior is correctly deferred to Phase 27.

## Human Verification Required

One external-host check remains non-blocking:
- Load the local plugin into a real OpenClaw workspace and confirm the host discovers `openclaw.plugin.json` plus the native MikoshiTracker tool catalog without requiring an MCP runner.

## Commands Run

- `pnpm install --ignore-scripts`
- `pnpm typecheck`
- `pnpm --filter @mikoshi-tracker/openclaw-plugin build`
- `pnpm --filter @mikoshi-tracker/openclaw-plugin exec vitest run test/plugin-manifest.test.ts test/plugin-bootstrap.test.ts test/tool-catalog.test.ts test/tool-registration.test.ts test/config/env.test.ts test/plugin-startup-errors.test.ts`
- `pnpm --filter @mikoshi-tracker/openclaw-plugin exec vitest run`
- `pnpm --filter @mikoshi-tracker/mcp exec vitest run test/client/api-client.test.ts test/client/errors.test.ts test/tools/inventory.test.ts`
