# Phase 29: Verification Gate and Migration Confidence Verification Report

**Phase Goal:** Prove the native plugin path works in-repo and is ready to replace the previous OpenClaw bridge in normal use.
**Verified:** 2026-03-11T22:09:00+08:00
**Status:** passed

## Goal Achievement

### Observable Truths

| # | Truth | Status | Evidence |
|---|-------|--------|----------|
| 1 | The repository-level OpenClaw verification gate now targets the native plugin path. | ✓ VERIFIED | `package.json` scripts `verify:openclaw` and `verify:openclaw:full` now run `@mikoshi-tracker/openclaw-plugin` tests first; `packages/openclaw-plugin/test/verification-smoke.test.ts` passed. |
| 2 | The repository now proves one native read flow and one safe native mutation flow against the real API test app. | ✓ VERIFIED | `packages/openclaw-plugin/test/native-integration.test.ts` passed against the real Fastify test app and token issuance flow. |
| 3 | Operators now have explicit migration guidance from the older OpenClaw MCP bridge path to the native plugin path. | ✓ VERIFIED | `docs/openclaw-migration.md` exists and is referenced by `docs/ai-agent-integration.md`, `docs/openclaw-validation-checklist.md`, and `docs/openclaw-troubleshooting.md`; doc smoke stayed green. |

**Score:** 3/3 truths verified

### Required Artifacts

| Artifact | Expected | Status | Details |
|----------|----------|--------|---------|
| `packages/openclaw-plugin/test/verification-smoke.test.ts` | Native verification gate smoke coverage | ✓ EXISTS + PASSED | Asserts root scripts and native proof surfaces align. |
| `packages/openclaw-plugin/test/native-integration.test.ts` | Real API-backed native read/write verification | ✓ EXISTS + PASSED | Uses fake OpenClaw registration + real API app. |
| `docs/openclaw-migration.md` | Explicit host migration note | ✓ EXISTS + PASSED | Explains old-vs-new setup while preserving env/auth contract. |

**Artifacts:** 3/3 verified

### Requirements Coverage

| Requirement | Status | Blocking Issue |
|-------------|--------|----------------|
| VER-01: v1.7 includes repository verification for plugin manifest/runtime loading, environment validation, and at least one read flow plus one safe mutation flow through the native OpenClaw plugin path. | ✓ SATISFIED | - |

**Coverage:** 1/1 requirements satisfied

## Anti-Patterns Found

None blocking after verification.

One honest scope boundary remains:
- The real OpenClaw UI/plugin loader and secret-store wiring still require external-host-only confirmation even though the repo now has the strongest available native proxy coverage.

## Human Verification Required

One external-host check remains non-blocking:
- Load the native plugin in a real OpenClaw workspace, confirm tool discovery, run one read and one safe mutation, and verify the migration note matches the real host workflow.
