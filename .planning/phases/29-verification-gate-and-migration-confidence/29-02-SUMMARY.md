    provides: Native-plugin-first verification scripts and smoke gate
provides:
  - real API-backed native plugin integration coverage
  - OpenClaw migration notes from MCP bridge to native plugin
  - full verification gate alignment with native read/write evidence

key-decisions:
  - "The strongest in-repo native proof is a fake OpenClaw host collecting registered handlers against the real API test app."
  - "Full verification now includes one real native read flow and one safe native mutation flow."
  - "Migration guidance is explicit and separate, rather than being implied across multiple docs."
patterns-established:
  - "OpenClaw transport migrations should preserve `MIKOSHI_TRACKER_API_URL` and `MIKOSHI_TRACKER_API_TOKEN` and change only the host transport layer."

# Phase 29 Plan 02: Native Integration and Migration Summary

**The repo now proves a real native read/write flow and ships explicit migration notes off the older OpenClaw MCP bridge**

## Performance

- **Duration:** ~25 min
- **Completed:** 2026-03-11
- **Tasks:** 2
- **Files modified:** 7

## Accomplishments
- Added `native-integration.test.ts`, which boots the real API test app, activates the native plugin, collects registered handlers, and proves one read plus one safe mutation through the plugin boundary.
- Extended `verify:openclaw:full` so the repository's full gate includes that native read/write evidence.
- Added `docs/openclaw-migration.md` and linked it from host-facing OpenClaw docs.

## Task Commits

No task commits were created in this workspace session. Phase 29 work is being finalized as one atomic phase commit after summaries and verification artifacts are written.

## Files Created/Modified
- `packages/openclaw-plugin/test/native-integration.test.ts` - Real API-backed native read/write verification.
- `docs/openclaw-migration.md` - Explicit migration note from old bridge path to native plugin path.
- `package.json` - Full OpenClaw verification gate now includes native integration coverage.
- `packages/openclaw-plugin/test/verification-smoke.test.ts` - Smoke assertions now cover full-gate integration and migration note presence.
- `docs/ai-agent-integration.md` - Migration note linked from host guidance.
- `docs/openclaw-validation-checklist.md` - Full gate and migration note reflected in verification guidance.
- `docs/openclaw-troubleshooting.md` - Migration reference added to operational troubleshooting.

## Decisions Made
- Used `today_get_summary` + `today_complete` as the minimal safe native read/write proof.
- Reused the API app test-helper seam instead of building a second fake API.
- Documented migration as a dedicated note to reduce operator ambiguity during host transition.

## Verification

- `pnpm --filter @mikoshi-tracker/openclaw-plugin exec vitest run test/native-integration.test.ts`
- `pnpm typecheck && pnpm --filter @mikoshi-tracker/openclaw-plugin build && pnpm --filter @mikoshi-tracker/openclaw-plugin exec vitest run test/plugin-manifest.test.ts test/plugin-bootstrap.test.ts test/plugin-startup-errors.test.ts test/config/env.test.ts test/tool-registration.test.ts test/result-envelope.test.ts test/error-semantics.test.ts test/read-tools.test.ts test/mutation-tools.test.ts test/native-integration.test.ts test/docs-native-openclaw.test.ts test/verification-smoke.test.ts && pnpm --filter @mikoshi-tracker/mcp exec vitest run test/client/api-client.test.ts test/client/errors.test.ts test/tools/habits-read.test.ts test/tools/habits-write.test.ts test/tools/today-stats-read.test.ts test/tools/today-write.test.ts test/tools/mutation-errors.test.ts`
- `pnpm verify:openclaw:full`

## Next Plan Readiness

- v1.7 is now ready for final audit and milestone close-out.
