# Quick Task 10 Summary

**Description:** 修复 MikoshiTracker OpenClaw 插件发布元数据，确保 OpenClaw 可直接发现加载启用
**Date:** 2026-03-13
**Code Commit:** `0e17c04`

## What Changed

- Added `package.json -> openclaw.extensions` with `["./dist/index.js"]` so the published package advertises the built extension entry directly to OpenClaw.
- Updated `openclaw.plugin.json` to include an explicit empty `configSchema` and aligned the manifest `id` with the package name `@mikoshi-tracker/openclaw-plugin` to avoid plugin id mismatch.
- Updated the canonical OpenClaw example config to use the same plugin key as the published package id.
- Expanded the package README so operators know the package now ships the discovery metadata and should load without local manifest patching.
- Tightened manifest/docs smoke tests to assert `openclaw.extensions`, manifest `id`, and example/config consistency.

## Verification

- `pnpm --filter @mikoshi-tracker/openclaw-plugin exec vitest run test/plugin-manifest.test.ts test/docs-native-openclaw.test.ts test/verification-smoke.test.ts`
- `pnpm --filter @mikoshi-tracker/openclaw-plugin build`
- `pnpm --filter @mikoshi-tracker/openclaw-plugin test`

## Outcome

The published OpenClaw plugin package now exposes consistent discovery metadata across `package.json`, `openclaw.plugin.json`, and the setup example, so OpenClaw can discover, load, and enable the built plugin directly without manual local patching.
