# Quick Task 3 Summary

**Description:** 把 mikoshi-tracker-mcp 的中英双触发词与示例落实到项目文档，并提交本次 Skill/文档更新
**Date:** 2026-03-10
**Code Commit:** `8ae50ce`
**Supporting Commit:** `0744e7f`

## What Changed

- Expanded the `mikoshi-tracker-mcp` Skill metadata so it now explicitly triggers on both English and Chinese request patterns such as `What should I do today?`, `今天该做什么`, `打卡`, `撤销打卡`, and `本周表现`.
- Added bilingual trigger examples directly inside the Skill so Skill-aware agents can match concrete Chinese habit-assistant requests instead of relying on English-only phrasing.
- Updated the Skill UI metadata prompt so the default invocation text now includes Chinese request types like `打卡`, `进度`, and `修改习惯`.
- Documented the bilingual trigger coverage in the root README and MCP package README so project readers can see that `mikoshi-tracker-mcp` is intended for both English and Chinese habit workflows.

## Verification

- `PYTHONPATH=/tmp/skill-validate-lib python3 /Users/finn/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/scripts/quick_validate.py .agents/skills/mikoshi-tracker-mcp`
- `pnpm --filter @mikoshi-tracker/mcp test`

## Outcome

The project documentation now matches the Skill behavior: `mikoshi-tracker-mcp` is documented as a bilingual today-first routing layer, not just an English-only MCP helper.
