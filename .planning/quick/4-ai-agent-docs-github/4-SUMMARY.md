# Quick Task 4 Summary

**Description:** 更新整体文档，说明机器人如何连接 MCP 与 Skill，并推送 GitHub
**Date:** 2026-03-10
**Code Commit:** `23dd215`

## What Changed

- Added a new top-level guide at `docs/ai-agent-integration.md` that explains the difference between MCP and Skill, the recommended connection order, and the right integration pattern for generic MCP clients versus Skill-aware agents.
- Linked the new guide from the root `README.md` so the main project docs now point readers to a dedicated answer for “how does my robot connect skills?”.
- Linked the same guide from `packages/mcp/README.md` so package operators can discover the broader host-by-host explanation from the MCP package docs.
- Tightened the `mikoshi-tracker-mcp` Skill wording so its activation order matches the new documentation: connect MCP first, load guidance, then invoke the Skill.

## Verification

- `PYTHONPATH=/tmp/skill-validate-lib python3 /Users/finn/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/scripts/quick_validate.py .agents/skills/mikoshi-tracker-mcp`
- `pnpm --filter @mikoshi-tracker/mcp test`
- `git push origin main`

## Outcome

MikoshiTracker now has one canonical document for robot/agent integration, and the main docs, MCP package docs, and project Skill all point to the same MCP-first, Skill-aware setup model.
